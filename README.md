This coding test is fairly simple. You need to write a web app that takes a name and searches for it in a database and returns where the person with that name lives. It also handles errors effectively at the frontend and API. We're looking at functionality, but we're also looking at application and data structure, legibility and maintainability.     Database  Your choice of SQL or NoSQL platform table or document that stores pairs of names and locations    Front end:  Basic user interface that contains elements:  title appropriate to functionality text box for entry of a name button to run search - calls REST API display of results properly handles errors and form validation coded in react or vue.    REST API that  receives calls from interface queries against database to return the location(s) the name is paired with in the database  returns data to front end coded in node.js
